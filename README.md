FEATURES:

 - Measures soil moisture, light and temperature.
 - It waters only at night.
 - It doesn't water if temperature is below 4ÂºC.
 - It waters depending on a preset value and a hysteresis.

 - It takes measurements every hour, then microcontroller goes to deep sleep.
 - If it irrigates, then checks moisture again after five minutes.
 - Measurements are uploaded to thingspeak.com
